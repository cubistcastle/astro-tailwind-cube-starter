# Astro Starter Kit with Tailwind, Open-Props (for fun), and CUBE conventions

Following [Andy Bell's](https://andy-bell.co.uk/) lead, this starter combines the CUBE system with Tailwind as the utility layer. Configured with JIT on Astro for great efficiency. Open Props is also included (and also setup for JIT props), for added flexibility when setting up styles.
